# Contributing to Agentic Systems

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Agentic Systems as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the coding style used throughout the project.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fouadcorp/agentic-systems/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
* Run code through a linter (like flake8) before submitting

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's MIT License.
